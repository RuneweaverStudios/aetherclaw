# Ralph Progress Log

## Codebase Patterns
- Project uses Python 3.11+ with type hints
- Memory files are Markdown-based for human readability
- SQLite used for indexing (brain_index.db)
- RSA-2048 keys for skill signing with cryptography library
- All configurations stored in JSON format
- Logging follows structured format with ISO 8601 timestamps
- All modules have CLI entry points with argparse
- GLM API calls use retry logic with exponential backoff
- Workers log thinking process before producing output

## 2026-02-12T22:00:00 - US-001 to US-019, US-022 to US-031
- Implemented core Aether-Claw system with 29/31 user stories complete
- Files changed: 28 new files created
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The cryptography library requires specific padding (PSS) for RSA signatures
  - Bandit scanner output is JSON format by default with -f json
  - Streamlit requires specific page config before other commands
  - GLM API uses Bearer token authentication
  - psutil is optional but provides better system monitoring
  - ThreadPoolExecutor works well for swarm worker orchestration
  - SQLite FTS5 provides excellent full-text search for memory
  - Audit log should be append-only for security compliance

## Remaining Tasks

### US-020: Docker isolation wrapper
- Need to create isolation/docker_wrapper.py
- Requires docker-py library
- Container creation with resource limits
- Network disabled by default

### US-021: Git worktree manager
- Need to create isolation/worktree.py
- Branch management for worker isolation
- Cleanup on completion
